# 题目描述：

The Employee table holds all employees. Every employee has an Id, a salary, and there is also a column for the department Id.

    +----+-------+--------+--------------+
    | Id | Name  | Salary | DepartmentId |
    +----+-------+--------+--------------+
    | 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 1            |
    | 2  | Jim   | 90000  | 1            |
    | 3  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
    | 4  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
    | 5  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
    +----+-------+--------+--------------+
The Department table holds all departments of the company.

    +----+----------+
    | Id | Name     |
    +----+----------+
    | 1  | IT       |
    | 2  | Sales    |
    +----+----------+
Write a SQL query to find employees who have the highest salary in each of the departments. For the above tables, your SQL query should return the following rows (order of rows does not matter).

    +------------+----------+--------+
    | Department | Employee | Salary |
    +------------+----------+--------+
    | IT         | Max      | 90000  |
    | IT         | Jim      | 90000  |
    | Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
    +------------+----------+--------+
Explanation:

Max and Jim both have the highest salary in the IT department and Henry has the highest salary in the Sales department.

# 最开始想到的解法（错误）：

    select Department.Name as Department,Employee.Name as Employee ,MAX(Employee.Salary) as Salary
    from Employee
    join Department
    on Employee.DepartmentId=Department.id
    group by Employee.DepartmentId
换成

    select *
    from Employee
    join Department
    on Employee.DepartmentId=Department.id
    group by Employee.DepartmentId
看了一下实际查询到的结果如下。

    {"headers":
    ["Id", "Name", "Salary", "DepartmentId", "Id", "Name"],
    "values":
    [[1, "Joe", 70000, 1, 1, "IT"],
    [3, "Henry", 80000, 2, 2, "Sales"]]}

发现是group by语句用错了，group by是用来根据一个或多个列对结果集进行分组

# 正确解法：
可以换个思路，我们先来查询每个部门的最高薪水：

    SELECT
        DepartmentId, MAX(Salary)
    FROM
        Employee
    GROUP BY DepartmentId;
查到的结果：

    | DepartmentId | MAX(Salary) |
    |--------------|-------------|
    | 1            | 90000       |
    | 2            | 80000       |

现在连接两张表，然后使用in语句把所有满足上面情况的雇员信息筛选出来：

    SELECT
        Department.name AS 'Department',
        Employee.name AS 'Employee',
        Salary
    FROM
        Employee
            JOIN
        Department ON Employee.DepartmentId = Department.Id
    WHERE
        (Employee.DepartmentId , Salary) IN
        (   SELECT
                DepartmentId, MAX(Salary)
            FROM
                Employee
            GROUP BY DepartmentId
    	)
    ;

查询结果：

    | Department | Employee | Salary |
    |------------|----------|--------|
    | Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
    | IT         | Max      | 90000  |
