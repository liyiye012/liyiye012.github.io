《涉事之屋：白宫回忆录》节选

<!-- more -->

端午假期看了前美国国家安全顾问博尔顿的白宫回忆录部分章节，这本6月23号出版的新书打着“特朗普不想让你们读的书”的名号反向营销，书中的一些内容还是挺有意思的。

例如用UC震惊体可以编几条标题《震惊! 特朗普竟视孟晚舟为义女》、《刚刚！芬兰被特朗普并入俄国》，也难怪特朗普痛批博尔顿是“被解雇的可怜的战争贩子”、“心怀不满的无聊傻子”。

这里摘几个涉及中国的片段共赏：

1. 在12月7日的白宫圣诞晚宴上，特朗普提到孟晚舟的被捕，称这给中国带来了巨大的压力。他在桌子对面对我（博尔顿）说，我们刚刚逮捕了"中国的伊万卡·特朗普"。


At the December 7 White House Christmas dinner, Trump raised Meng’s arrest, riffing about how much pressure this put on China. He said to me across the table that we had just arrested “the Ivanka Trump of China.”

2. 双方领导人谈话中提到凡尔赛条约，特朗普明显对此没概念（考虑到他曾在二战爆发纪念日祝贺波兰，不知道凡尔赛条约很正常）

XI answered by comparing the impact of an unequal deal with us to the “humiliation” of the Treaty of Versailles, which had taken Shandong province from Germany but given it to Japan. XI said with a straight face that if China suffered the same humiliation in our trade negotiations, there would be an upsurge of patriotic feeling in China, implicitly indicating that that feeling would be directed against the United States. Trump manifestly had no idea what XI was referring to,

3. （农产品谈判取得进展后）"你是三百年来最伟大的中国领导人！" 特朗普兴高采烈地说，几分钟后，特朗普将其修改为"中国历史上最伟大的领导人"。

“You’re the greatest Chinese leader in three hundred years!” exulted Trump, amending it a few minutes later to be “the greatest leader in Chinese history.”

4. （贸易战谈判期间）特朗普最后说，莱特希泽将负责交易，库什纳（驸马爷）也将参与其中，此时所有的中国人都露出了笑容。

Trump closed by saying Lighthizer would be in charge of the deal-making, and Kushner would also be involved, at which point all the Chinese perked up and smiled.


5. （提到香港问题时）"这是一个大问题，"他（特朗普）说，但立即补充说，"我不想参与"，和"我们也有人权问题"。

“That’s a big deal,” he said, but immediately added, “I don’t want to get involved,” and “We have human-rights problems too.” 

6. (某个三十周年纪念日)特朗普拒绝发表白宫声明。姆努钦告诉特朗普，他担心声明草案对贸易谈判的影响，并想淡化它。这已经够糟了， 但特朗普说他一点也不想要任何声明。"那是十五年前的事了，"他说，不准确。"谁在乎呢？我想做个交易我不要任何东西"

Trump refused to issue a White House statement. Mnuchin told Trump he worried about the effects of the draft statement on the trade negotiations and wanted to water it down. That was bad enough, but Trump said he didn’t want any statement at all. “That was fifteen years ago,” he said, inaccurately. “Who cares about it? I’m trying to make a deal. I don’t want anything.” 

7. 特朗普最喜欢的对比之一是指着他的笔尖，并说，"这是台湾，"然后指着坚毅桌说，"这是中国"


“Although it came in several variations, one of Trump’s favorite comparisons was to point to the tip of one of his Sharpies and say, “This is Taiwan,” then point to the Resolute desk and say, “This is China.”

8. 特朗普想废除两任总统任期的宪法限制

One highlight came when Xi said he wanted to work with Trump for six more years, and Trump replied that people were saying that the two-term constitutional limit on Presidents should be repealed for him. I was aware of no such chatter. Knowing Xi was effectively “President for life” in China, Trump was trying to compete with him. Later in the dinner, Xi said the US had too many elections, because he didn’t want to switch away from Trump, who nodded approvingly. (Indeed, in a subsequent telephone conversation on December 29, Xi said expressly that China hoped Trump would have another term by amending the Constitution so he could stay longer.)

9. 然后，他(特朗普)令人吃惊地将谈话转向了即将到来的美国总统大选，暗示中国的经济能力会影响正在进行的竞选活动，恳求习确保他获胜。他强调了农民和中国增加购买大豆和小麦在选举结果中的重要性。

He then, stunningly, turned the conversation to the coming US presidential election, alluding to China’s economic capability to affect the ongoing campaigns, pleading with Xi to ensure he’d win. He stressed the importance of farmers, and increased Chinese purchases of soybeans and wheat in the electoral outcome.
